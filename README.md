# Lecture on emerging infectious disease

This is a presentation I give to undergraduate students taking Part II Pathology at the University of Cambridge; this version is from February 2014, so (already!) some of the material may be out of date. I used a variety of sources; please let me know if there isn't enough information about the provenance of any item. A particularly notable source is Andrew Rambaut's excellent website:

There are still a few wrinkles in the presentation; the hantavirus video doesn't show up automatically, and the D3 based chart on emerging infections doesn't display at the right size. These can be fixed by refreshing the page, but feel free to submit pull requests if you can fix these, or have any improvements in the material.
